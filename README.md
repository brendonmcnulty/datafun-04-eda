## Purpose
This project demonstrates the use of Jupyter Notebooks for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  
It focuses on using **pandas**, **seaborn**, and **matplotlib** to explore datasets, generate statistics, and create visualizations.  
The primary dataset for this module is the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in data science.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows PowerShell
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the notebook in VS Code or JupyterLab and select the correct Python kernel.

## Usage
- Run the cells in `brendon_eda_notebook.ipynb` step by step.
- Review commentary after each section for explanations and insights.
- Use this as a model for building clear, story-driven data analysis notebooks.
